# Calculator with gulp, node, and webpack

I plan to have multiple themes to choose from, multiple temporary saves for if the user wants to
do a few different calculations and save that so they can use it later.  No DB for now so it will
just be until they close the browser/tab and will have to choose your color each time.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:richi1717/calculator.git
$ npm i
$ gulp dev
```

May have to install gulp, webpack, and or node sass:

```
$ npm i -g gulp webpack node-sass
```

Then go to localhost:3000.

`server.js` is already set up to handle different routes and so is react-router.
